A Cash Flow Minimizer, made by my teammates and I for our Data Structures IA - II
<hr>
The concept of the code is utilised in the case of a group people who have to pay money to each other within the group. The cashflow minimizer using the concept of graphs will reduce the payments to the minimum which reduces the number of transactions to be occured and makes it easier to handle the money.
